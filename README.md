# ng-github-viewer
githubViewer is a single page application written in AngularJS 1.3.

I wrote the application to learn the core features of the AngularJS framework. The app demostrates how two-way data binding makes it easy to build pages and forms while maintaining simplicity in the JavaScript code. It also utilizes the essential abstractions of AngularJS, including:
- modules
- controllers
- directives
- services
